public class Encapsulation1 {

}


















//@@Encapsulation is a mechanism through which we can wrapping the variables and methods of class in a single unit 
//while preventing unauthorized access
//@@I used getter/Setter Method to achieve Encapsulation. 
//@@In encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function 
//of its own class
//@@Declare the class method as public / Declare the variables /data members as Private
//@@It allows implementation details to be hidden and while exposing public interface for interaction.
